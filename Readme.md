# Wine Quality Predictor

So I wanted to practice some machine learning in python, after a lot of struggle in OCTAVE ðŸ˜–(Its not bad, its good but I don't like the workflow of it.).

> So I decided to do some small project from a blog post.

## [Python Machine Learning Tutorial, Scikit-Learn: Wine Snob Edition](https://elitedatascience.com/python-machine-learning-tutorial-scikit-learn)

A nice and small project. Had fun.
